# Aircraft Simulator

This project simulates aircraft movement without using Unity's built-in physics engine. All forces and torques (such as thrust, lift, drag, pitch, roll, and yaw) are manually calculated and applied to the aircraft for full control over its movement.

The architecture and some collision logic can definitely be improved 

### **Control Scheme**

- **Throttle (Thrust):**
  - **W**: Increase thrust
  - **S**: Decrease thrust

- **Pitch (Up/Down):**
  - **Up Arrow**: Nose up (pitch up)
  - **Down Arrow**: Nose down (pitch down)

- **Roll (Left/Right):**
  - **A**: Roll left
  - **D**: Roll right

- **Yaw (Turn Left/Right):**
  - **Left Arrow**: Yaw left
  - **Right Arrow**: Yaw right
